title: UAV path-planning and communication joint optimization
summary: This project tries to solve the non-convex optimisation problem of finding an optimal path for a UAV to move from  a base station to a target/inspection point while respecting the strict constraint of power,and data transmission rate. The problem is first transformed into a convex optimisation problem and solve using classical optimisation algorithms in CVXPY.
