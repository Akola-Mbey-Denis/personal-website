title: PlantDoc, plant leaf disease detection and treatment recommendation.
summary: This is a work in progress,and I plan to include in this project a recommendation system that would use the predictions of the ResNet101 as input and then would recommend treatment options for the identified disease. Also,I would build a mobile application to make this model easily accessible to farmers so that they can use this application on any smart phone. The model currently identify some diseases  in apples maize/corn,blueberry,potatoe,tomato,and cherry.
