title: PlantDoc,plant leaf disease detection and treatment recommender.
summary: This is a work in progress, and I plan to include in this project
a recommendation system that would use the predictions of the ResNet101 as input and then would recommend treatment options
for the identified disease. Also,I would build a mobile application to make this model easily accessible to farmers so that
they can use this application on any smart phone. The model currently identify some diseases  in apples maize/corn,blueberry,
potatoe,tomato,and cherry.
