title: PlantDoc
summary: Tis project leverages on ResNet101 CNN feature extractor to build a robust plant leaf disease detection system to help diagnose and characteristed plant leaf diseases. This is a work in progress and I plan to include in this project a 
recommendation system that would use the predictions of the ResNet101 as input and then would recommend treatment options for the identified disease. Also, I would build Mobile application to make this model easily accessible to farmers so that they can use
this application on any smart phone.
