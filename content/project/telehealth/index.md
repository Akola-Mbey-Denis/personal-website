summary: Implemented a user-friendly frontend interface for the HomDoc patient mobile application. Incorporated into the app video, chat, and call functionalities that enable patients to communicate with medical doctors. Implemented a scheduling algorithm to assign patients to the earliest available doctors if they choose such a service. This product has helped to provide improved access to quality healthcare and allowing patients to have access to the services of doctors across the globe.
