**Mentorship:** I am always excited to mentor and support others to realize their potential. I have mentored a couple of students in my community. I have being involved in mentoring students brilliant, but needy students and also guiding them to apply for scholarships to pursue university education.

**Leadership:** I founded a non-governmental organisation called TechOne Foundation in Zebilla,my hometown in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Through this intiative,I team up with my friends in the community to provide ICT lessons to students in the community. We have plans to extend of scope of influence to provide training programs in data science and software engineering to help the youth and school dropouts in Zebilla to acquire skills in these demanding areas to make themselves employable.Also,in France,I serve as the Media Secretary of National Union of Ghanaians Students France Chapter.

**Tutoring:** I also spent sometime to tutor students in my community.  During my time as a teaching assitant at the Department of Computer Engineering, I lead tutorial lessons in Computer Vision,and Computer Graphics. In these sessions,I helped the students to have a better grasp of core course concepts that were taught by my proffessors.  


**Volunteering:** I took part in a number of community give back iniatives during my time as a [Mastercard Foundation Scholar](https://mastercardfdn.org/all/scholars/). From teaching high school students to blood donation campaigns. I cherish every opportunity I have to give back to my community and I am looking forward to doing more.
