**Mentorship:** I am always excited to mentor and support others to realize their potential. I have mentored a couple of students in my community. I have being involved in mentoring  brilliant, but needy students and also guiding them to apply for scholarships to pursue university education.

**Leadership:** I founded a non-governmental organisation called TechOne Foundation in Zebilla,my hometown in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Through this intiative, I team up with my friends in the community to provide ICT lessons to students. We have plans to extend of scope of foundation to provide training programs in data science and software engineering to help the youth and school dropouts in Zebilla to acquire skills in these demanding areas to make themselves employable.Also, in France, I serve as the media secretary of National Union of Ghanaians Students France Chapter.

**Tutoring:** I  spent sometime to tutor students in my community.  During my time as a teaching assitant at the Department of Computer Engineering, I lead tutorial lessons in Computer Vision,and Computer Graphics. In these sessions, I helped the students to have a better grasp of core course concepts that were taught by my proffessors.  


**Volunteering:** I took part in a number of community give-back initiative during my time as a [Mastercard Foundation Scholar](https://mastercardfdn.org/all/scholars/). From teaching high school students to blood donation campaigns. I cherish every opportunity I have to give back to my community and I am looking forward to doing more. 
In 2018,I spent two (2) months as a volunteer at [Turing Trust Foundation](https://turingtrust.co.uk/ghana/) in Kumasi,Ghana. As a technical assistant,I installed useful softwares and fix glitches on recycled computers that were distributed to various schools across the country to aid in the teaching and learning  of ICT in basic and Junior High Schools in Ghana

Please feel free to reach out if you want to colloborate on something, I am always open to learning from other people's ideas. Together we can make the world better and put smiles on the faces of people who need such.
